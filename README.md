# Vue-Monster-Slayer

This is a practice project to practice every core feature Vue has. As you can see on the video, it's a battle system simulator where you can attack, heal, and use a special attack that deals more damage or surrender the fight. This app has an additional battle log that shows the person who plays what is happening.

## Lessons

### DOM & Templates
- Declarative approach with Vue
- Vue connection to HTML and real DOM rendering

### Reactivity
- Vue updating the DOM when bound data changes
- Computed properties and watchers which allow you to react to data changes

### Data & Event Bindings
- Bind data via '{{}}' - interpolation or ':' - v-bind directive
- Listening for events via '@' - v-on

### Styling
- Dynamic CSS class and inline style bindings
- Multiple special syntaxes (object-based, array-based) for efficient bindings

### Conditional Content
- v-if, v-else-if, v-else, and v-show render the specific condition

### Lists, v-for Variations, Keys
- v-for to render elements dynamically - arrays, objects, and ranges (numbers)
- Can extract values, indexes, keys
- Vue re-uses DOM elements to optimize performance and binds the key attribute to a unique value to help Vue identify elements

## Challenges and Results
- Used everything that I have learned before
- Working with different events and methods, computed properties, and watchers
- Dynamic content and style attributes
- Making different scenarios a reality, using different abilities, and making a working game
- Code is reusable, has no code duplications and close to modification, and is open to extension
